# Sales Outreach

Generate personalized B2B sales outreach that gets replies. Cold emails, LinkedIn messages, follow-up sequences — all tailored to the prospect and written in the seller's voice.

## Core Principles

1. **Personalization is not "Hi {FirstName}."** Real personalization shows you understand their world — their problems, their context, their priorities. Generic outreach with a name inserted is spam.

2. **Lead with insight, not pitch.** The first message should teach something or show understanding. The product comes second. Especially in deep tech where buyers are allergic to being sold to.

3. **One message, one idea, one ask.** Never stack multiple value props or CTAs in a single message. Simplicity gets replies.

4. **Short wins.** Under 100 words for cold emails. Under 300 characters for LinkedIn connection requests. Brevity signals respect for their time.

5. **Sound human.** No corporate speak. No "I hope this finds you well." No "leveraging synergies." Write like a smart colleague, not a marketing department.

## Before Writing: What to Ask

1. **"Who is the prospect?"** — Company, role, name. Ideally share a lead-researcher brief or key context.
2. **"What are you selling?"** — Product/service, core value prop, key differentiator.
3. **"What's the outreach channel?"** — Cold email, LinkedIn, or both.
4. **"What's the ask?"** — Meeting, demo, reply, introduction? Define the desired outcome.
5. **"Any reference material for your voice?"** — Previous emails that worked, brand guidelines, or examples of how you/the client writes.

## Frameworks

### AIDA (Attention → Interest → Desire → Action)
Best for: Structured cold emails where you need to build a case.

| Step | Purpose | Example |
|---|---|---|
| **Attention** | Hook with something relevant to them | "Repsol's R&D team cut additive screening time by 80%." |
| **Interest** | Connect to their likely problem | "Most specialty chemicals teams still run the same wet lab process from 10 years ago." |
| **Desire** | Show what's possible | "Nextmol replaces months of lab work with computational screening in days." |
| **Action** | Clear, soft ask | "Worth a 15-minute look?" |

### PAS (Problem → Agitate → Solution)
Best for: Prospect has a known, acute pain point.

| Step | Purpose | Example |
|---|---|---|
| **Problem** | Name the specific problem | "Screening new surfactant formulations takes your team 4-6 months per iteration." |
| **Agitate** | Show the cost of inaction | "That's 2-3 product launches per year instead of 10. Meanwhile, competitors using computational methods are moving faster." |
| **Solution** | Bridge to your product | "We help teams like yours run 1000x more candidates in silico before touching a lab." |

### BAB (Before → After → Bridge)
Best for: Transformation stories, especially with social proof.

| Step | Purpose | Example |
|---|---|---|
| **Before** | Their current state | "Your team spends 6 months on each formulation cycle." |
| **After** | The better state | "Clariant now screens candidates in 3 weeks." |
| **Bridge** | How to get there | "They switched to computational chemistry with Nextmol. Happy to show you how." |

## Content Types

### Cold Email (First Touch)

**Structure:**
1. **Subject line** — Short, specific, no clickbait. Reference their world. (e.g., "R&D screening at [Company]" not "Exciting opportunity!")
2. **Opening** — One sentence showing you know their context. No pleasantries.
3. **Insight or hook** — One relevant data point, observation, or question.
4. **Bridge** — One sentence connecting to what you do.
5. **Ask** — Soft CTA. One question.
6. **Signature** — Name, title, company. No novel-length signatures.

**Rules:**
- Under 100 words (body, excluding signature)
- No attachments
- No "we" in the first sentence — start with them
- No links in first cold email (triggers spam filters)
- Subject line under 6 words

### LinkedIn Connection Request

**Rules:**
- Under 300 characters (LinkedIn's limit)
- No pitch. Just a reason to connect.
- Reference something specific: mutual connection, their content, shared interest, event.

**Templates:**
- "Saw your [post/talk] on [topic] — really resonated with our work in [area]. Would love to connect."
- "We both work in [industry/niche]. I share content on [relevant topic] — thought it might be useful to connect."
- "[Mutual connection] suggested I reach out. Working on [relevant thing]. Happy to connect."

### LinkedIn Message (After Connected)

**Structure:**
- Acknowledge the connection (briefly)
- Share one relevant insight or resource (not a pitch)
- Ask a question or offer value

**Rules:**
- Under 150 words
- Don't pitch in the first message after connecting
- Give before you ask — share something useful first

### Follow-Up Email Sequence

**Cadence:**
| Email | Timing | Approach |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Day 0 | Insight + soft ask (use framework above) |
| 2 | Day 3 | Different angle, same problem. Add a data point or example. |
| 3 | Day 7 | Social proof — case study, quote, or result |
| 4 | Day 12 | Value-add — share a relevant article, report, or observation |
| 5 | Day 18 | Breakup — "Seems like timing isn't right. No worries. [Leave door open]" |

**Rules:**
- Each email should stand alone — assume they didn't read previous ones
- Never reference "my last email" — it signals you're tracking them
- Each email introduces a new angle, not a repeat
- The breakup email often gets the highest reply rate — keep it short and gracious
- Vary send times (not all at 9am Tuesday)

### Re-engagement Email (Cold Lead Revival)

For leads that went dark:
- Reference the original context briefly
- Share something new (result, news, product update)
- Keep it under 60 words
- "No pressure" tone

## Personalization Layers

From weakest to strongest:

| Level | Example | Impact |
|---|---|---|
| **Name only** | "Hi Sarah" | Minimal — everyone does this |
| **Company** | "I noticed [Company] is expanding into..." | Basic — shows you looked them up |
| **Role-specific** | "As VP of R&D, you're probably dealing with..." | Good — shows you understand their job |
| **Trigger-based** | "Saw you just raised Series B / hired 3 ML engineers / posted about..." | Strong — shows you're paying attention |
| **Insight-based** | "Most [industry] teams lose 60% of R&D time to [specific problem]..." | Strongest — shows you understand their world |

Always aim for trigger-based or insight-based personalization.

## Anti-Patterns

| Pattern | Why It Fails |
|---|---|
| "I hope this finds you well" | Marks you as generic/automated |
| "I'd love to pick your brain" | Asks for their time with no value offered |
| "We're the leading provider of..." | Nobody cares about your self-description |
| "Just following up" | Empty — add new value or don't send |
| "I know you're busy, but..." | Apologetic tone undermines your message |
| Sending a pitch as a connection request | Gets declined and burns the contact |
| 10-paragraph emails | Nobody reads them. Under 100 words. |
| Multiple CTAs | "Book a demo, download our whitepaper, and follow us" — pick one |
| Feature lists | They don't care about features. They care about their problem. |

## Voice Calibration

If the user provides examples of outreach that has worked for them, analyze for:
- Tone (formal/casual, technical/accessible)
- Length patterns
- How they open and close messages
- Use of data vs. story vs. question

Match their voice. If no examples provided, default to: professional, concise, conversational, confident without being pushy.

## Integration with Other Skills

- Use **lead-researcher** output as the basis for personalization
- Use **call-prep** when the outreach succeeds and a meeting is booked
- Use **positioning-builder** output for consistent value proposition messaging
- Use **b2b-writer** for longer-form content (blog posts, whitepapers) referenced in outreach
- Use **icp-profiler** to ensure you're reaching the right people

## Output

Deliver the outreach content ready to send. Include:
- Subject line (for emails)
- Full message body
- Notes on personalization points (what to customize per prospect if doing a batch)
- Recommended send timing
