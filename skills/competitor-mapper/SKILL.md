# Competitor Mapper

Systematic competitive analysis framework that goes beyond feature comparison to analyze strategic positioning, moats, and vulnerabilities — plus website-level positioning intelligence via hero section analysis.

## When to Use
- Client entering a market with existing players
- Need to identify competitive differentiation
- Sales team needs battle cards
- Positioning work requires understanding alternatives
- Want to understand how competitors position themselves publicly (hero messaging)

## Core Framework: Competitive Analysis Matrix

For each competitor, analyze across **15 dimensions**:

| Dimension | What to Capture |
|-----------|-----------------|
| Competitor | Company name + website URL |
| Hero H1 (Website Positioning) | The main H1 heading from the competitor's homepage hero section. This reveals how they position their product and brand to the market. |
| Key Features Summary | Top 3-5 product features or capabilities prominently promoted on their website and marketing materials |
| Use Cases / Verticals | Which industries, verticals, or use cases they focus on (e.g., FinTech, HealthTech, eCommerce, DevOps) |
| Funding to Date | Total funding raised (signals resources and runway) |
| Target Segment (ICP) | Who they sell to |
| Value Proposition | What core pain do they solve? (Functional + Economic + Emotional) |
| Competitive Strategy | Cost leadership / Differentiation / Focus |
| Growth Motion | PLG / SLG / MLG / Hybrid |
| Pipeline Strategy | Inbound / Outbound / Partner |
| Monetization Model | SaaS, Usage, Enterprise Contracts, Marketplace |
| Structural Advantage (Moat) | Network effects, Brand strength, Data advantage, Ecosystem lock-in, Capital advantage, Switching friction |
| Switching Costs | Financial, operational, technical, psychological |
| Strategic Vulnerability | High CAC, poor retention, overpriced for midmarket, weak differentiation |
| Direct Threat Level | Direct / Indirect |

## Hero Section Analysis (H1 Scraping)

For each competitor, visit their homepage and capture:

1. **H1 headline**: The primary hero heading — this is how they position to the market
2. **H1 subheadline**: Supporting text under the H1 (if present)
3. **CTA text**: What the primary call-to-action button says (e.g., "Start Free Trial", "Book a Demo", "Get Started")

### What the Hero H1 Reveals
- **Product-led positioning**: H1 describes what the product does ("Build apps 10x faster")
- **Outcome-led positioning**: H1 describes the result ("Close deals faster")
- **Category-led positioning**: H1 names a category ("The AI Sales Platform")
- **Audience-led positioning**: H1 addresses a persona ("For engineering teams who...")

### How to Capture H1s
Use web browsing or search to visit each competitor's homepage. Extract the H1 element from the hero section. If the site uses JavaScript rendering, read the page content after load. Record the exact text — do not paraphrase.

## Key Features & Verticals Analysis

For each competitor:

### Key Features
- Visit the competitor's features/product page
- Capture the top 3-5 features they promote most prominently
- Note any unique or differentiating capabilities
- Look at pricing page tier names for feature prioritization signals

### Use Cases / Verticals
- Check for industry-specific pages or case studies
- Note any vertical-specific language in their marketing
- Identify if they are horizontal (all industries) or vertical-focused
- Map which verticals they actively target with dedicated content

## Competitive Categories

Always map three types:
1. **Direct competitors**: Same solution, same customer
2. **Indirect competitors**: Different solution, same problem
3. **Status quo**: Doing nothing / manual processes / spreadsheets

## Workflow

1. **Identify competitors**: 5-8 direct, 3-5 indirect, define status quo
2. **Scrape hero sections**: Visit each competitor's homepage, capture H1, subheadline, CTA
3. **Analyze features & verticals**: Visit product/features pages, capture top features and target verticals
4. **Research each competitor** across all 15 matrix dimensions
5. **Score threat levels**: Rate each as Direct/Indirect threat
6. **Identify gaps**: Where is no competitor strong? Which verticals are underserved?
7. **Analyze positioning patterns**: What positioning approach dominates? Where is there room to differentiate?
8. **Map vulnerabilities**: Where can you win?
9. **Create battle cards**: Per-competitor sales enablement docs (include their H1 positioning for context)
10. **Output**: Competitive landscape report + battle cards + positioning analysis

## Output Artifacts
- Competitive analysis matrix (full 15-dimension comparison table)
- **Hero Positioning Analysis** (table of all competitor H1s with positioning type classification)
- **Features Comparison Matrix** (features by competitor, highlighting gaps)
- **Verticals Heatmap** (which competitors serve which verticals, identifying whitespace)
- Competitive positioning map (2x2 visualization)
- Sales battle cards (per competitor, including their public messaging)
- Win/loss analysis framework
- Differentiation summary

## Key Principles
- Status quo (doing nothing) is often the biggest competitor
- Moats matter more than features
- Analyze growth motions — they reveal go-to-market strategy
- H1 headlines reveal strategic positioning intent — track them over time
- Features tell you what they built; verticals tell you who they built it for
- Switching costs are the real barrier to winning deals
- Update quarterly — competitive landscapes shift fast
