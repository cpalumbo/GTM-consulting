## Workflow

1. **Classify the launch** — EPIC, MAJOR, or MINOR?
2. **Set launch date** and work backwards
3. **Activate channels** based on tiering matrix
4. **Create content calendar** with all assets needed
5. **Brief all teams** — sales, CS, support, marketing
6. **Execute pre-launch** — teasers, early access, press prep
7. **Launch day** — coordinated activation across all channels
8. **Post-launch** — measure, iterate, amplify what works

## Output Artifacts
- Launch tier classification and rationale
- Integrated marketing plan (channel × activities matrix)
- Content and asset checklist
- Launch timeline (Gantt-style)
- Team briefing document
- Post-launch measurement plan
