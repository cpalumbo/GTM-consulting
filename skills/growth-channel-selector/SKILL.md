# Growth Channel Selector

Help clients choose the right 2-3 growth channels based on their ICP, resources, and growth motion.

## When to Use
- Client needs to decide where to invest marketing/sales budget
- Current channels aren't performing
- Expanding into new channels
- Building initial channel strategy for a new product

## Channel Scoring Matrix

Score each channel 1-5 on these dimensions:

| Dimension | 5 = Best | 1 = Worst |
|-----------|----------|-----------|
| Potential | Massive reach to ICP | Very limited reach |
| Cost (inverted) | Very cheap | Very expensive |
| Reach | Broad audience | Narrow audience |
| Time to Test | Can test in days | Takes months to test |

**Score = Potential + Cost + Reach + Time to Test** (max 20)

## Workflow

1. **List all candidate channels** (use the 18 channels as starting point)
2. **Score each channel** using the 4-dimension matrix
3. **Rank by total score** and identify top 5-6
4. **Assess current situation** — what's already running? What's working?
5. **Select 2-3 primary channels** based on score + resources + motion fit
6. **Design initial experiments** for each selected channel
7. **Set KPIs and review cadence** (monthly channel reviews)
8. **Plan channel layering** — add channels as you scale

## Growth Motion Recommendation Engine

Before scoring channels, determine the recommended growth motion based on client intake data:

### Decision Framework
| Signal from Client | Recommended Motion |
|---|---|
| ACV < $1K, self-serve possible, product is intuitive | **PLG** |
| ACV $5K-$50K, needs demo, 1-2 decision makers | **SLG** (velocity sales) |
| ACV $50K+, complex sale, multiple stakeholders, long cycle | **SLG** (enterprise sales) |
| Category is established, content drives demand, inbound works | **MLG** |
| Strong developer community, open-source component | **CLG** (Community-Led Growth) |
| Product used by teams, built-in sharing/collaboration | **PLG + viral** |
| Multiple segments (SMB self-serve + Enterprise sales) | **Hybrid PLG + SLG** |

### What's Already Working (Double-Down Logic)

During the client intake, you learn what channels and activities are currently generating results. Apply this logic:

1. **If a channel is working but under-invested** → Recommend scaling it (more budget, more content, more reps)
2. **If a channel is working and fully invested** → Recommend optimizing conversion rates within it
3. **If no channels are working yet** → Recommend the highest-scored channels from the matrix, starting with the cheapest to test
4. **If the client has data showing what works** → Weight the scoring matrix toward proven channels

### Recommendation Output Format

For each recommended channel, provide:
- **Channel name** and type (Marketing / Sales / PLG / CLG / Partnerships)
- **Why this channel**: Specific reasoning tied to the client's ICP, motion, and resources
- **Quick win** (what to do in the first 2 weeks)
- **30-day experiment plan** with specific tactics
- **Budget needed** (estimated monthly spend)
- **KPIs to track** (leading and lagging indicators)
- **Tools needed** (specific tool recommendations from the GTM engineering stack)
- **Expected timeline to results** (when to expect measurable impact)

## Key Principles
- Start with 2-3 channels max, go deep before going wide
- Channel selection must match your growth motion (PLG, SLG, MLG)
- **Always double down on what's already working before adding new channels**
- LinkedIn organic + thought leadership is the fastest B2B channel
- Content marketing is a long-term compounding asset
- Reddit is underrated for dev audiences
- Always have one channel you own (email, community)
- Recommendations must be specific and actionable, not generic
