# Pricing Strategist

Help clients choose and implement the right pricing model based on their product, market, and growth motion.

## When to Use
- Client needs to set initial pricing
- Reviewing pricing for a new segment or motion
- Revenue isn't scaling as expected
- Transitioning between pricing models
- Competitive pressure on pricing

## Workflow

1. **Understand the product** — what value does it deliver?
2. **Map the growth motion** — PLG needs self-serve pricing; SLG can support custom
3. **Analyze competitors** — what do alternatives cost?
4. **Assess buyer willingness to pay** — interviews, surveys, pricing research
5. **Select pricing model(s)** — match to product, motion, and buyer
6. **Set price points** — informed by WTP, competition, unit economics
7. **Design packaging** — tiers, features, limits
8. **Plan pricing communication** — how to present and justify
9. **Set review cadence** — revisit every 3-6 months

## Key Principles
- Price is the currency of value exchange
- 72% of innovation fails due to pricing/monetization flaws
- Don't set prices too cheap (destroys perceived quality)
- Different segments have different willingness to pay
- Pricing should match your growth motion
- Revisit pricing every 3-6 months

## Output Artifacts
- Pricing model recommendation with rationale
- Competitive pricing analysis
- Tier/package design
- Unit economics model (CAC, LTV, payback period)
- Pricing communication guide
