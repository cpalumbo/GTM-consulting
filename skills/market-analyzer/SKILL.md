# Market Analyzer

Helps clients define, validate, and size their target market using data-driven frameworks.

## When to Use
- Client needs to choose between multiple market segments
- Market sizing is required (TAM/SAM/SOM or bottom-up)
- Validating whether a market opportunity is attractive enough
- Selecting a beachhead segment for initial GTM focus

## Core Frameworks

### Market Definition Template
"Our company helps [X customers] do [Y] thanks to [Z]"

This simple statement should be the starting point for every market analysis. If the client can't fill this in clearly, the market isn't defined.

### Market Validation Scoring (1-5 Scale, Weighted)

Score each market segment across these 10 dimensions:

| # | Criterion | Weight | Question |
|---|-----------|--------|----------|
| 1 | Urgency | 3 | How badly do companies want/need this right now? |
| 2 | Market Size | 3 | How many companies are actively purchasing things like this? |
| 3 | Pricing Potential | 3 | What is the highest average price a purchaser would be willing to spend? |
| 4 | Cost of Customer Acquisition | 1 | How easy is it to acquire a new customer? How much money and effort? |
| 5 | Cost of Value-Delivery | 1 | How much would it cost to create and deliver the value, in money and effort? |
| 6 | Uniqueness of Offer | 1 | How unique is the offer versus competing offerings? How easy is it to copy? |
| 7 | Speed to Market | 1 | How quickly can you create something to sell? |
| 8 | Up-Front Investment | 1 | How much will you have to invest before you're ready to sell? |
| 9 | Up-Sell Potential | 1 | Are there related secondary offers you could present to customers? |
| 10 | Evergreen Potential | 1 | Does it keep selling with minimal additional work? Or constant effort? |

**Market Attractiveness Score**: 15 = Nightmare, 80 = Paradise

### Market Size Potential (Bottom-Up)

For each segment, calculate:

| Variable | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| S (Market Universe) | Total number of companies in each segment |
| P (Price) | Average Price or Contract Value (Annual) |
| A (Accessibility) | % Penetration achievable in each segment |

**Market Potential = S × P × A**

### Top 10 Accounts

For each segment, identify the 10 most promising accounts. This grounds the analysis in real companies and validates that the segment has enough quality targets.

## Workflow

1. **Define the market** using the "helps X do Y thanks to Z" template
2. **Identify 3-4 candidate segments** with the client
3. **Score each segment** using the 10-dimension weighted matrix
4. **Calculate market size** using bottom-up S×P×A for top segments
5. **List Top 10 accounts** per viable segment
6. **Recommend beachhead segment** based on combined attractiveness + size + fit
7. **Output**: Market Analysis Report with scoring matrix, sizing, and recommendation

## Output Artifacts
- Market validation scoring matrix (segment comparison table)
- Bottom-up market sizing calculations per segment
- Top 10 target accounts per segment
- Beachhead segment recommendation with rationale

## Key Principles
- Always use bottom-up sizing (not top-down TAM fantasies)
- Weight urgency, market size, and pricing potential 3x (they matter most)
- Beachhead must be winnable in 18 months or less
- Real company names in Top 10 = reality check
