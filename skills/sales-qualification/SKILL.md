# Sales Qualification (MEDDICC)

Help clients implement structured deal qualification using MEDDICC to improve win rates and forecast accuracy.

## When to Use
- Client has enterprise B2B sales process
- Win rates are low or unpredictable
- Deals stall in pipeline without clear reason
- Sales team needs a common qualification language
- Improving forecast accuracy

## MEDDICC Framework

| Element | Questions to Ask | What Good Looks Like |
|---------|-----------------|---------------------|
| **M - Metrics** | What is the business case? What is the #1 metric we impact? | Quantified business impact (e.g., "increase revenue by 25%, reduce costs by 5%") |
| **E - Economic Buyer** | Who signs the contract? What are the professional/personal wins for that person? | Identified by name and title; understand their personal motivation |
| **D - Decision Criteria** | What's the formal decision criteria? What do we need to bring to the table? | Written list of evaluation criteria; your solution maps to them |
| **D - Decision Process** | What's the timeline? Whose in the buyer journey? | Clear timeline with milestones; all stakeholders mapped |
| **I - Identify Pain** | What are the high-level reasons for change? What's the implication of no change? | Pain is urgent and quantified; cost of inaction is clear |
| **C - Champion** | Who has the power and influence to drive the opportunity? | Named champion who is actively selling internally for you |
| **C - Competition** | Who is the competition? What are their strengths? | Know all competitors in the deal; have counter-positioning ready |

## MEDDICC Scoring

For each deal, score each element 1-3:

| Score | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| 1 | Not identified / Weak |
| 2 | Partially identified / Developing |
| 3 | Fully identified / Strong |

**Deal Score**: Sum of all 7 elements (max 21)
- 18-21: Strong deal, likely to close
- 12-17: Needs work on weak areas
- Below 12: At risk, needs immediate action plan

## Example: Filled MEDDICC

| Element | Example |
|---------|---------|
| Metrics | Increase revenue by 25%, reduce costs by 5%, increase uptime by 2% |
| Economic Buyer | CEO signs, gets recognized as TOP 10 CEO in industry, increases stock option bonus package |
| Decision Criteria | # of successful customers in the same industry, 5x financial ROI within 12 months, realistic business case, Head of Rev Ops committed to implement |
| Decision Process | Need to take decision by end of quarter. Need one-pager proposal for monthly board meeting. Convince CIO and Head of Risk + Head of Finance. Then get PO from Procurement |
| Pain | New regulation creating challenge. New strategy requiring integrated solution. If nothing changes, company will decline from #1 market position. Opportunity costs of $50k/week and uncaptured marginal revenue of $500k |
| Champion | Decision Maker: CxO XYZ. Problem Owner: Head of ABC. Influencer: Head of IT/Finance |
| Competition | Competitor A: Strong track record, 2-3x more expensive. Competitor B: Less expensive, no case studies. Status Quo: "worked just fine so far" |
