# Positioning Builder (April Dunford Method)

Guide clients through creating differentiated positioning that makes their product obviously the best choice for their target customer.

## When to Use
- Client needs to define or refine their positioning
- Product is being compared unfavorably to alternatives
- Messaging isn't resonating with target customers
- Entering a new market or segment
- Launching a new product

## Core Principle

Positioning is not what you say about your product.
Positioning is how you define the product in a specific market context so that it is obviously the best choice for a specific customer.
Positioning is about comparison.

## The 5 Components of Strong Positioning

### 1. Competitive Alternatives
What would customers use if you did not exist? Not just direct competitors.

Include: Status quo, Manual processes, Spreadsheets, Internal builds, Adjacent tools

If you define alternatives too narrowly, your positioning will be weak.

**Diagnostic question**: What is the default solution today?

### 2. Unique Attributes
What do you have that competitors do not? Be concrete.

Examples: Proprietary data, Unique workflow, Performance advantage, Integration depth

### 3. Value (Outcomes)
Translate attributes into customer value.

Formula: Attribute → Value → Business Impact

### 4. Target Market
Who cares most about the value you deliver?

Define by: Industry, Company size, Maturity level, Trigger events

### 5. Market Category
What category does your product belong to?

Category determines: Comparison set, Budget source, Buyer expectations, Sales cycle

Wrong category = wrong buyers.

## Positioning Workflow (Sequential)

This order matters — each step builds on the previous:

1. List competitive alternatives
2. Identify unique attributes
3. Translate attributes into value
4. Identify best-fit customers
5. Choose the market category deliberately

Only after these steps should messaging be written. Messaging comes last.

## Common Positioning Mistakes
- Starting with slogans
- Avoiding competitive comparison
- Targeting too broad a market
- Using vague differentiation
- Choosing a category that inflates competition

## Clean Positioning Template

We help:
  [Best-fit customer]
Who are struggling with:
  [Primary problem / alternative]
By providing:
  [Product category]
That delivers:
  [Core differentiated outcome]
Unlike:
  [Primary alternative]
We uniquely:
  [Clear differentiating attribute]

## Output Artifacts
- Positioning statement (clean template filled in)
- ICP definition (for positioning context)
- Differentiation map (attributes → value → impact)
- Competitive analysis (alternatives landscape)
- Category decision rationale

## Strategic Note

Positioning is not permanent. Revisit when:
- Entering new segments
- Adding new capabilities
- Facing new competitors
- Shifting upmarket
- Changing revenue motion

## Workflow

1. **Workshop competitive alternatives** with client team
2. **List unique attributes** (be brutally honest)
3. **Map attributes to value** using "So what?" chain
4. **Define best-fit customer** using ICP data
5. **Choose market category** with rationale
6. **Write positioning statement** using clean template
7. **Test with customers** and iterate
8. **Create messaging** based on positioning (messaging comes LAST)
