# Lead Researcher

Research and enrich B2B leads with actionable intelligence. Turn a company name into a full account brief that sales can act on.

## When to Use

- Researching a specific prospect company before outreach
- Enriching a list of leads with context
- Building target account profiles for ABM campaigns
- Identifying buying signals and pain points for a prospect
- Mapping key stakeholders at a target account

## Before Researching: What to Ask

1. **"What company (or companies) should I research?"** — Name, URL, or domain
2. **"What are you selling?"** — The product/service and its value proposition (or reference the client brief if one exists)
3. **"What specifically do you need to know?"** — Or use the default full research template below

## Research Template (Default)

For each company, produce an **Account Intelligence Brief** covering:

### 1. Company Overview
- What they do (one paragraph, plain language)
- Industry and sub-segment
- Headquarters, size (employees), founding year
- Stage (startup / scaleup / enterprise)
- Funding status and recent rounds (if applicable)
- Revenue indicators (public filings, estimates, growth signals)

### 2. Business Context
- Core products/services
- Target customers and markets they serve
- Business model (SaaS, services, marketplace, etc.)
- Recent strategic moves (acquisitions, partnerships, expansions, pivots)
- Public challenges or headwinds (layoffs, leadership changes, regulatory issues)

### 3. Technology & Operations
- Known tech stack (check job postings, BuiltWith, Wappalyzer, GitHub)
- Key tools and platforms they use (CRM, marketing automation, analytics)
- Engineering culture signals (open source contributions, blog posts, conference talks)

### 4. Pain Points & Opportunities
Based on the product being sold, identify:
- Problems this company likely faces that the product solves
- Evidence of those problems (job postings, complaints, reviews, industry trends)
- Timing signals — why now? (new initiative, growth, regulation, competitive pressure)
- Potential objections and how to address them

### 5. Key People
- Decision maker(s) for the product category (title, name if findable)
- Champions / influencers (technical evaluators, end users)
- LinkedIn profiles where available
- Recent posts, articles, or talks by key people (useful for personalization)

### 6. Competitive Landscape (at the Prospect)
- What they currently use for the problem you solve (incumbent solution)
- Competitor products they may be evaluating
- Switching costs and barriers

### 7. Buying Signals
- Job postings that indicate need (hiring for roles your product supports)
- Recent news suggesting initiative or budget (funding, new exec, expansion)
- Technology changes (migration, new stack adoption)
- Industry events or regulatory changes affecting them

### 8. Outreach Angle
Based on all the above, recommend:
- **The hook** — the single most relevant reason to reach out now
- **The insight** — one thing you can teach them that they might not know
- **The ask** — what a natural first conversation looks like

## Research Methods

Use all available tools:

| Method | What to Look For |
|---|---|
| **Company website** | About page, product pages, blog, careers, press |
| **LinkedIn** | Company page, employee count, recent posts by leaders, job openings |
| **Job postings** | Titles being hired for, tools mentioned, growth areas |
| **News / press** | Funding, partnerships, product launches, leadership changes |
| **Industry reports** | Market trends, competitive landscape, regulatory changes |
| **Review sites** | G2, Capterra, TrustRadius — what customers say, complaints |
| **GitHub / tech blogs** | Tech stack clues, engineering priorities |
| **Financial data** | Crunchbase, PitchBook for funding; SEC filings for public companies |
| **Social media** | Twitter/X, Reddit — sentiment, public discussions |

## Output Format

Deliver as a structured **Account Intelligence Brief** using the template above. Keep it factual and actionable — no filler.

For multiple companies, deliver a summary comparison table first, then individual briefs.

## Integration with Other Skills

- After research, use **sales-outreach** to draft personalized outreach based on the brief
- After research, use **call-prep** to prepare for a meeting with this prospect
- Use the **icp-profiler** output to guide which companies to research
- Use the **competitor-mapper** output to understand competitive context

## What Makes Good Lead Research

- **Specificity over breadth** — "They posted 3 ML engineer roles in January" beats "They're growing their team"
- **Recency matters** — prioritize information from the last 6 months
- **Connect to the product** — every insight should tie back to why the product is relevant to them
- **Name people** — sales happens between people, not companies
- **Identify the incumbent** — knowing what they currently use is more valuable than knowing their revenue
