# ICP Profiler

Helps clients build research-driven customer profiles that guide all GTM decisions — from messaging to channel selection to sales qualification.

## When to Use
- Client needs to define who they're selling to
- Moving from "everyone" to a focused target customer
- Building buyer personas for sales and marketing alignment
- Transitioning from Early Customer Profiles to Ideal Customer Profiles

## Core Frameworks

### Customer Profile Matrix (ECP → ICP)

Two stages of customer profiling:

**Early Customer Profiles (ECP)**: Based on first customers — who actually bought
**Ideal Customer Profiles (ICP)**: Based on best customers — who you want more of

For each profile, capture:

| Dimension | Questions |
|-----------|-----------|
| Companies | What companies did buy your product? |
| ACV | What's the ACV? Recurring + one-off? |
| Pains Solved | What pains did you solve or try to solve for them? |
| Results Achieved | What results do your customers achieve or want to achieve? |
| Firmographics | Industry, headcount, revenue, relevant technologies used |
| Decision-Maker Persona | Title, seniority, geography, years in current company |
| Champion Persona | Title, seniority, geography, years in current company |

### Granular Buyer Persona Framework

For each persona type (e.g., Founder & CEO, VP Sales, Sales Rep), build a deep profile:

**Demographics**
- Name, Age, Nationality, Geography
- Titles, Company Size, Industry

**Background**
- Education, career path, key experiences

**Goals**
- Quotes (in their own words)
- Desired Metrics (what numbers they want to hit)
- Desired Outcomes (what success looks like)
- Desired Emotions (how they want to feel)

**Status Quo**
- Current Activities (daily work)
- Current Tools (what they use today)
- Influences and Information Sources (what they read, who they follow)
- Current Emotions (how they feel about status quo)

**Problems**
- Biggest Challenge
- Other Relevant, Urgent Challenges (3-4 additional)
- Current Metrics (what they're tracking that isn't working)

**Frustrations & Fears**
- Frustrations (with current approach)
- Failures (what they've tried that didn't work)
- Anxiety (what they're afraid of)

## Workflow

1. **Audit existing customers**: List all current customers with ECP template
2. **Identify patterns**: Which customers are most successful? Highest ACV? Fastest close?
3. **Build ICP hypothesis**: Based on best customer patterns
4. **Create granular personas**: Deep profiles for decision-maker and champion
5. **Validate**: Customer interviews, sales team input, data analysis
6. **Document and distribute**: Create shareable ICP cards for sales and marketing

## Output Artifacts
- ECP/ICP comparison matrix
- Granular buyer persona documents (per role)
- ICP one-pager for sales team
- Persona-based messaging matrix

## Key Principles
- ECPs come from data (who actually bought), not imagination
- ICPs come from best customers (who you want more of)
- Always profile both the decision-maker AND the champion
- Use real quotes and language from customer interviews
- Firmographics + technographics = account-level ICP
- Psychographics + behaviors = persona-level ICP
