# Positioning Workshop Playbook

A 2-hour facilitated workshop using April Dunford's methodology.

## Pre-Work (Send to Client 1 Week Before)
- List your top 5-10 customers and why they chose you
- List 3-5 alternatives your customers considered
- Describe your product in one sentence (no jargon)
- What do customers say they love most?

## Workshop Agenda

### Part 1: Competitive Alternatives (25 min)
**Prompt**: "What would your best customers do if your product didn't exist?"

- Brainstorm all alternatives (not just competitors)
- Include: status quo, manual processes, spreadsheets, internal builds, adjacent tools
- Group and prioritize by frequency

### Part 2: Unique Attributes (20 min)
**Prompt**: "What do you have that none of these alternatives have?"

- List concrete capabilities, not vague claims
- Be specific: proprietary data, unique workflow, integration depth, performance
- Eliminate anything a competitor could claim too

### Part 3: Value Translation (20 min)
**Prompt**: "So what? Why does each attribute matter to the customer?"

For each unique attribute:
- Attribute → Customer Benefit → Business Impact
- Use the "So what?" chain until you reach business value
- Prioritize by importance to best-fit customers

### Part 4: Best-Fit Customers (15 min)
**Prompt**: "Who cares most about the value we just identified?"

- Define by firmographics (industry, size, stage)
- Define by situation (trigger events, current pain)
- Narrow ruthlessly — positioning for everyone = positioning for no one

### Part 5: Market Category (15 min)
**Prompt**: "What category should we position in to make our value obvious?"

Options:
- Existing category (ride the wave)
- Sub-category (niche within existing)
- New category (create a new space — hardest option)

Category determines: comparison set, budget source, buyer expectations, sales cycle

### Part 6: Write the Statement (25 min)
Fill in the clean positioning template:

We help: [Best-fit customer]
Who are struggling with: [Primary problem / alternative]
By providing: [Product category]
That delivers: [Core differentiated outcome]
Unlike: [Primary alternative]
We uniquely: [Clear differentiating attribute]

## Post-Workshop
- Circulate positioning statement for feedback
- Test with 3-5 target customers
- Create messaging framework based on positioning
- Update website, sales deck, and collateral
- Review positioning quarterly
