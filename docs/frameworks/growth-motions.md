# Growth & Revenue Motions

How we acquire customers and expand revenue. The key question isn't "which motion do I pick?" but "which motion do I start with?" — then add others as you scale.

## The 5 Growth Motions

### Marketing-Led Growth (MLG)
Driven by demand generation activities. A strategic and integrated marketing approach aimed at building awareness and interest to fuel a predictable sales pipeline. Demand gen activities include: content, SEO, email marketing, social media, events & webinars, ABM. MLG typically fuels inbound pipeline — attracting customers through content and campaigns, capturing leads, and handing them to an inside sales team.

### Product-Led Growth (PLG)
The product is the main driver of acquisition, conversion, and retention, often using freemium or free-trial models. PLG generates its own pipeline through product usage signals — Product-Qualified Leads (PQLs) — rather than traditional lead forms. Best starting motion when your product can deliver value with minimal onboarding friction.

### Sales-Led Growth (SLG)
SLG primarily drives outbound pipeline — proactive outreach by sales teams to targeted accounts — but also converts inbound leads that require a sales process. It can be layered with Customer Success to facilitate retention and revenue expansion when ACV is high enough.

### Partner-Led Growth (Ecosystem)
Utilizes resellers, affiliates, technology integrations, and channel partners to expand reach and accelerate sales. Best suited for marketplace or channel expansion strategies.

### Community-Led Growth (CLG)
Fosters a user community to drive product adoption, advocacy, and brand loyalty. Particularly powerful for technical products — open-source projects, developer communities, Discord/Slack groups, and meetups can become a primary acquisition channel.

## How to Choose Your Starting Motion

| Variables | Self-Serve Buyer (can evaluate & buy alone) | Complex Buyer (needs education, multi-stakeholder) |
|-----------|---------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| Lower ACV | PLG or CLG | MLG → Inside Sales |
| Higher ACV | PLG with expansion (e.g., Snowflake, Datadog) | SLG (Outbound) + MLG (ABM if well defined set of accounts) |
| Ecosystem play (integrations, marketplaces, channel) | Partner-Led + PLG (e.g., Shopify apps, Zapier integrations) | Partner-Led + SLG (e.g., consulting/SI partners, resellers) |

## Hybrid Motions
Most successful companies layer motions over time. For example: PLG for self-serve adoption → add SLG when moving upmarket → MLG running throughout to build awareness.

## Pipeline Generation Motions
- **Inbound**: Prospects come to you via marketing (MQLs), community, product (PQLs) or partners. May involve handoff to inside sales team.
- **Outbound**: Sales reaches out to prospects. Leans on marketing for reputation building and ABM activities.
- **Hybrid**: Most common among B2B companies.

## Overlay Questions for Motion Selection
- Do you have a natural community or ecosystem to tap into? → Consider CLG or Partner-Led
- Can your product deliver an "aha moment" without a demo? → Strong PLG signal
- Are you selling to a known, finite set of accounts? → SLG + ABM
- Is your ACV below $1,000? → PLG likely necessary
- Is your ACV above $50,000? → SLG likely necessary
- Do you have existing content assets or thought leadership? → MLG advantage
