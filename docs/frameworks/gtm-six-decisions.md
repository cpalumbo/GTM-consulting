# The 6 GTM Decisions Framework

Every Go-To-Market strategy requires confident decisions in these six interconnected areas. They should be addressed in this sequence, as each builds on the previous.

## 1. Market
**Question**: What is the market opportunity you're going after? How big is it and how is it segmented?

Choose your terrain. Win one segment before expanding (beachhead strategy).

## 2. Customer Profile (ECP/ICP)
**Question**: Who are your target customers? When bringing an innovation to market, it's crucial to focus on the "Innovators." Niche down the "Early Customer Profiles" before the "Ideal Customer Profiles."

Know your buyer deeply — demographics, psychographics, behaviors, pains, and aspirations.

## 3. Product
**Question**: What is your value proposition and product? What does your competitive landscape look like (direct, indirect competitors, substitutes, and status quo)?

Articulate what you do, why it matters, and how it's different.

## 4. Pricing
**Question**: How should you price the product?

Price is the currency of value exchange. Match pricing model to growth motion and buyer expectations.

## 5. Positioning
**Question**: How do you present it in a unique and compelling way? Be narrow.

Define the product in market context so it's obviously the best choice for your target customer.

## 6. Growth
**Question**: How do you acquire customers? What are the main motions and channels?

Select 2-3 channels, design growth loops, and build pipeline predictably.

## Desired Outcome
**Build pipeline more quickly and predictably.**
